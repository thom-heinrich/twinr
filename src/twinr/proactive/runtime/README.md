# runtime

Proactive monitor orchestration and wakeword presence-session control for Twinr.

This package wires the runtime-facing monitor loop, degraded sensor handling,
and presence-session state used to arm wakeword listening and proactive checks.

## Responsibility

`runtime` owns:
- Coordinate proactive monitor ticks across PIR, camera, ambient audio, and wakeword policy paths
- Maintain wakeword presence-session state from recent sensor activity
- Derive conservative ReSpeaker audio-policy hooks such as quiet windows, resume windows, and overlap guards
- Derive conservative ReSpeaker speech-delivery defer reasons such as background media or non-speech room activity
- Export normalized observation facts and ops telemetry from proactive monitoring
- Inject ReSpeaker XVF3800 signal facts into runtime audio observations when that device is targeted
- Keep bounded ReSpeaker audio observation alive while Twinr is already speaking so interruption facts do not go blind in `answering`
- Emit explicit operator-readable ReSpeaker runtime alerts for DFU, disconnect, and recovery state changes
- Open and close the bounded proactive monitor worker and its resources

`runtime` does **not** own:
- Score social triggers or define proactive prompt content
- Implement wakeword matching, calibration, or evaluation algorithms
- Implement raw camera, PIR, or microphone adapters
- Enforce delivery cooldown policy after a trigger becomes a candidate

## Usage

```python
from twinr.proactive.runtime import build_default_proactive_monitor

monitor = build_default_proactive_monitor(
    config=config,
    runtime=runtime,
    backend=backend,
    camera=camera,
    camera_lock=camera_lock,
    audio_lock=audio_lock,
    trigger_handler=trigger_handler,
)
if monitor is not None:
    with monitor:
        ...
```
